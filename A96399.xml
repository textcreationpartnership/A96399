         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But as for his own Name, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceals it, whether from a Jealouſie of his Work, or from a Conſciouſneſs of his own Diſreputation, that it may weaken the Credit thereof; or from a Fear of incurring ſome of the <hi>Papiſts</hi> diſpleaſure, and endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gering his own Promotion, if they ſhould have a <hi>Day.</hi> for ſome Reflections upon them, in his unjuſtly char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the <hi>Quakers</hi> with <hi>Popery;</hi> only he ſubſcribeth <hi>Miſoplanes</hi> and <hi>Philalethes,</hi> whereby he would be thought to be <hi>a Hater of Error,</hi> and <hi>a Lover of Truth;</hi> but his Work will manifeſt the contrary, that as a Lover of his own Erroneous Wayes he ſhews an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Hatred to Truth. His chief Quarrel is againſt the <hi>inherent or inward Righteouſneſs of Chriſt Jeſus, for the compleating our Juſtification and Salvation,</hi> and againſt the <hi>Light of Chriſt in Man,</hi> and the Doctrine of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection</hi> or <hi>Freedom from Sin being attainable in this Life;</hi> as alſo againſt the Light and Spirit of Chriſt being the <hi>only or chiefeſt Rule of Faith and Life</hi> (as it is) to all true ſpiritual <hi>Chriſtians</hi> and Believers above Scripture; ſo that the true Goſpel and New Covenant, <hi>Urim</hi> and <hi>Thummim,</hi> to wit, <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Perfection, true Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> and <hi>Holineſs,</hi> in the Breaſt-plate of Judgment, in the Royal Prieſthood of Chriſt, are ſtumbled at, and blaſphemouſly oppoſed by this inveterate Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, to the great Diſgrace of his Coat, and Shame of his Profeſſion, and Diſparagement of his More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave and Learned Brethren, for ſuffering ſuch a furious diſcompoſed Agent to be ſuch a publick Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate in their Cauſe, who when he can't Anſwer,
<pb facs="tcp:152498:3"/>nor give any modeſt Reply, he Reviles, Hectors, Vaunts, Boaſts, Scoffs and Jeers, as if by that means he would conquer all; when he cannot Reaſon, he Rails and Clamours moſt hideouſly; when he cannot confute his Oppoſers, nor remove the Charges againſt him, and thoſe of his Spirit and Fraternity, he recites and reiterates the Charges with Taunting, Jeering and Scoffing; and his chief Refuge and confuting Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument is, The <hi>Church of</hi> England, <hi>the Church of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land<hi>'s Faith is Oppoſed;</hi> though I muſt needs ſay, he has greatly wrong'd and miſrepreſented that Church in ſeveral particulars, wherein he is here reprehended; for ſhe ſhould not be made worſe than ſhe is: and inſtead of endeavouring to convince the <hi>Quakers</hi> in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Chriſtian way of their being <hi>Deluded,</hi> as he char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, he does not only unjuſtly render a <hi>Real Quaker</hi> as being a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> and charge <hi>Popery</hi> upon him, for hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch plain Scripture-Truths, relating to the <hi>new Birth,</hi> and <hi>Juſtification by Grace received, not excluding the Merit or Deſerving and Dignity of Chriſt in his Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, Death and Sacrifice for Mankind, as an obtaining and procuring Cauſe thereof,</hi> for all truly believing in him: But alſo our Adverſary ſhews himſelf offended at the King's Lenity towards Peaceable Diſſenting <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants,</hi> nothing leſs will ſatisfie him, than to have the Prieſts exalted, and their Deſigns carried on over all, by the ſecular Magiſtrate, that they may be atop, and both Kings, Princes and Subjects ſubſervient to them, which hath been alwayes a <hi>Popiſh</hi> deſign; and to this purpoſe this Prieſt, in his very Title Page, has given us a Citation which is very grateful to the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Clergy, (viz.) <hi>Neque enim aliunde haereſes obortae ſunt,
<pb facs="tcp:152498:4"/>aut nata ſunt ſchiſmata, quam inde quod ſacerdoti Dei non obtemparatur; Divus Cyprianus libro primo, Epiſtola tertia:</hi> i.e. For neither from any thing elſe, Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies have riſen, nor Schiſms bred, but hence, that O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience is not yielded to God's Prieſt. So that its Obedience to the Prieſts our Adverſary chiefly aims at, as the chief Obligation to prevent Hereſie and Schiſm, and that the Security both of Church and State, Kings and Princes may center in the Prieſts in all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obedient to them; if by ſuch Inſinuation they (of this mind) could get the Miter ſet above the Crown, their Princes not obeying ſuch Prieſts, nor ſiding with their Selfiſh Intereſt, may be liable to be Condemned (if not Depoſed) as Hereticks. This our Adverſary greatly endeavours to incenſe the King and Government to Severity or Perſecution againſt the deſpiſed People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> uſing ſuch Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions as theſe, <hi>Is it not high time for the King's Sacred Majeſty to ariſe and judge?</hi> pag. 5. and ſurely, <hi>'Tis high time for the King's Majeſty, the Defender of the Faith, to gird on his Sword;</hi> comparing the <hi>Quakers</hi> to <hi>ſtinging Snakes in the Boſom of Indulgence;</hi> calling the <hi>Quakers</hi> Meeting or Church, <hi>an Unlawful Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle, the Congregation of Evil-doers,</hi> pag. 43. and not only accuſing the <hi>Quaker</hi> with being <hi>no Loyal Subject,</hi> but alſo with <hi>Treaſon</hi> and <hi>Rebellion:</hi> His Out rage being chiefly becauſe <hi>Hat and Knee Honour,</hi> and ſuch Worldly Out-ſide Complements and Earthly Honour cannot be complyed with by the Plain, Simple-heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Impartial <hi>Quaker,</hi> who being in the Faith of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, has an Eye to that Honour which comes from God only, and not that which is from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
<pb facs="tcp:152498:4"/>earthly, and muſt all be laid in the Duſt. Thus this Adverſary has not only reflected on the King's Indulgence, and ſought to inſtigate him againſt his Peaceable <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Subjects, but alſo like a <hi>Popiſh</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendiary to divide and weaken the real <hi>Proteſtant</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, and animate the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and introduce <hi>Popery</hi> and Arbitrary Government in Church &amp; State, which with Perſecution and Coertion to uphold it, is <hi>Popery</hi> in the higheſt; and therefore, whilſt this Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man makes a great Noiſe againſt <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Popery,</hi> he is but under a Diſguiſe, to cover his own Popiſh Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gid Perſecuting Arbitrary Self-Willed Spirit, and therein carrying on the Deſign of <hi>Popery;</hi> and not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in this of Perſecution, but alſo in his very Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, Doctrine and manner of Arguing, where in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of Rationally Confuting the <hi>Quaker,</hi> he cryes up the <hi>Faith and Authority of the Church,</hi> as having the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Biſhops</hi> or <hi>outward Powers</hi> on his ſide therein; like as if he ſhould impoſe upon us, that we muſt be of the Faith of that Church that has a Coercive Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to maintain her; and what Intereſt will not this ſerve? And where he frequently calls the Virgin <hi>Mary the Mother of God,</hi> he ſhews himſelf greatly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended at the <hi>Quaker</hi> for deeming the Phraſe <hi>Popiſh and Unſcriptural,</hi> pag. 26, 27.

<pb facs="tcp:152498:5"/>is our preſent Adverſary's pleading and contending for Sin term of Life? and which is worſe, charging the beſt of men with ſinning daily, ſo long as they live; let the ſerious Reader Judge, when he reads the Controverſie hereafter.

            <p>I would ask, what that Righteouſneſs, that Chriſt fulfilled wholly without them was? Did it not conſiſt in his Obedience to the Father, and fulfilled in his Sufferings and Death? If this, then has compleated Juſtification <hi>wholly without</hi> men, then it muſt be compleated for all Mankind, for whom he dyed.

            <p> Again, If the Father's Kindneſs to Mankind was no whit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeriour to the Son's Kindneſs, or that they were both alike kind to Man (as 'tis not to be doubted) then it was in the freeneſs of the Father's Love that Chriſt came to redeem or purchaſe loſt Man to God. It was by the Grace of God that he taſted Death for every man, and became a Sacrifice of a ſweet ſmelling Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to God. But where the <hi>Prieſt</hi> ſayes, <hi>God-Man purchaſed our Redemption of God;</hi> this ſuppoſes him as God to be the chief Agent in purchaſing Redemption of God: Can this mean any otherwiſe than that either God did ſo purchaſe or buy this of himſelf? or elſe, that Chriſt, as a God inſeriour to the Moſt High God, did buy it of him? which ſo much borders on <hi>Socinian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm,</hi> denying the Deity of the Son of God, or that he is the Moſt High God, that I cannot be thus <hi>Socinianiz'd.</hi> For though Jeſus Chriſt be both God &amp; Man, in abſolute and wonderful Union, yet thoſe Works and Sufferings of his in the Fleſh, which concern'd Man's Reconciliation, Eternal Redemption and Salvation, with Reſpect to his Merit and Dignity therein, they all related to Chriſt, as Mediator between God and Man; and as ſuch he is called the <hi>Man Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> and in theſe Conſiderations he is made inferiour to the Father, as he ſaid, My Father is greater than I: We have one Mediator between <hi>God and Men,</hi> even <hi>the Man Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> It was as <hi>Man</hi> that he dyed, and gave himſelf <hi>a Ranſom for all,</hi> and it was by this <hi>One Man</hi> Jeſus Chriſt that the Grace and Gift of God hath abounded unto many; as <hi>by man</hi> came Death, ſo <hi>by man</hi> came the Reſurrection of the Dead; this is Scripture Language: and accordingly <hi>Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> by Chriſt [as his giving himſelf for us, to <hi>Redeem us from</hi> ALL <hi>Iniquity, from the Vain Converſation, from the Earth, &amp;c.]</hi> is truly owned by us.</p>

For if the Blood of Bulls and Goats ſprinkling the unclean, ſanctifieth to the purifying of the Fleſh; how MUCH MORE ſhall the Blood of Chriſt, who through the Eternal Spirit offered himſelf without Spot to God, Furge your Conſcience from Dead Works to ſerve the Living God. Hence it moſt clearly follows, that that Eternal Redemption, which Chriſt obtained for us by his Blood and Sacrifice without us, muſt be partaken of and enjoyed within us, by a real purging and ſanctifying of our Conſcience, as before. And ſince Remiſſion of Sins, Redemption and Juſtification are attributed to the Blood of Chriſt, as Means or Cauſe thereof through Faith; it follows, that though theſe were obtained by the Sacrifice of Chriſt without us, they are effected and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated by him within us, for our abſolute diſcharge from the Guilt of Sin, Condemnation and Curſe, by a real Purging our Conſciences, and Purifying of our Hearts by a true <hi>Faith</hi> in the Name of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, whereby we partake of the Effects and Benefits both of his Merit and Sufferings outward, and his effectual Work inward to our Salvation from Sin, and the ſad Effects thereof.</p>

            <p>Qr. <hi>G.W.</hi> Now if Profeſſors come not to <hi>feel</hi> and <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience</hi> theſe Things or Works of Chriſt (viz. Reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Redemption, Salvation, Juſtification) fulfilled within them, they are but meer empty Profeſſors and Talkers of them, without the true Life and Power of Chriſtianity and true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
            <p>[Prieſt anſwers, p. 16.] <hi>They are</hi> Quakers <hi>in Heart, ill prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipled in</hi> Chriſtianity, <hi>who do not ſee plainly, how this</hi> Quaker<hi>'s Spirit hath put him upon playing the Sophiſter, as well as an Ignora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus in it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Here he counts us Ill principl'd in <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſters and Ignoramus's, for aſſerting, that Reconciliation, Redemption, Salvation, Juſtification, muſt be fulfilled within, as much as to tell us, that Profeſſors poſſeſs the true Life and Power of <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> without having theſe Works of Chriſt fulfilled within them, as if they were all wholly compleated without them, without reſpect to the Work of Chriſt within them. This is ſtill his old <hi>Antinomian</hi> Notion, which he would father upon the <hi>Church of England;</hi> but how contrary not only to Scripture, but alſo to the Seventeenth Article of the Biſhops, concerning thoſe who are Choſen in Chriſt, let the ſerious Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der judge. The words in the ſaid Article are theſe, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Wherefore they which be endued with ſo excellent a Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:152498:18"/>of God, be called according to God's Purpoſe, by his Spirit working in due ſeaſon, they through Grace obey the Calling, they be <hi>juſtified</hi> freely, they be made Sons of God by Adoption, they be made like the Image of his Only Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Son Jeſus Chriſt, they walk Religiouſly in good Works, and at length by God's Mercy they attain to Everlaſting Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Here is as much ſaid for me, as I can deſire, to this Adverſary's Confutation; diſcovering not only his Abuſe of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> but of his own Church, in his pleading for a Juſtification of men wholly without them, ſo wholly excluding the Works of Chriſt from within, leaving them under the Dominion of Sin and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan. But this is not all, but alſo in the ſaid 17th Article there are theſe words, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>And ſuch as feel in themſelves the working of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Chriſt mortifying the Works of the Fleſh and their Earthly Members, and drawing up their Minds to High and Heavenly Things—fervently kindle their Love towards God.</q>
            </p>
            <p>How plain is it that here is Confeſſion to the working of God's Spirit, even to the <hi>feeling if it within,</hi> Obedience to his Calling, being made Sons of God, conformable to the Image of his Son, &amp;c. included in the State of Juſtification, contrary to our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary's WHOLLY WITHOUT. By which 'tis ſtill evident, how he has contradicted the Church of <hi>England</hi> in this Point.</p>
            <p>Pr. <hi>There is not one Syllable of Redemption by Purchaſe to be found in it,</hi> p. 16.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> He intends this of my ſenſe of certain Scripture<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terms relating to Chriſt and his Work, pag. 8, 9. of my Book, <hi>Nature of Chriſtianity;</hi> but herein he has ſhamefully belyed me. For <hi>Redemption</hi> is found, and thus explained in it, <hi>viz.</hi> A Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoming, Buying again, a Reſcuing, or Recovering ſuch as were under Bondage, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Pr. p. 17. <hi>Not only ignorantly, but baſely explain'd—they muſt be all felt and experimentally fulfill'd within Profeſſors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> No baſe Explanation to feel and Experience Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:152498:19"/>Salvation, &amp;c. the Works of Chriſt fulfilled within. But this man ſhews his Baſeneſs in contemning this, and his Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piction to the Biſhops Article before cited; elſe, what mean thoſe words therein, <hi>viz. Such as feel in themſelves the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Spirit of Chriſt, mortifying the Works of the Fleſh, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Pr. Ibid. <hi>Juſtification is altogether Popiſhly explained; a plain Inſtance, that the</hi> Quakers <hi>Light within is from</hi> Rome, <hi>below, and not from Heaven above.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is an Abuſe again, 'tis not Popiſhly explain'd by us. For though the Papiſts place <hi>the firſt Juſtification of men through the Means and Merits of Chriſt to be, when God finds no good Works to Reward, but Sins to Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don—unto ſuch as have Faith in him,</hi> yet they hold a ſecond Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and Salvation <hi>through the Merits of their own Works by the Aſſiſtance and Co-operation of God's Spirit

            </p>
            <p>Whereas we place the Merit, Deſerving or Dignity wholly upon Chriſt, both in his obtaining Redemption for us, and his working in us that which is well-pleaſing to the Father, and his enabling us to do thoſe things that pleaſe him; wherein our Acceptance is wholly in him, both with reſpect to his Suffering for us, and his working in us, and his working by us; and what good we do by his Aſſiſtance, 'tis but our Duty, not our Merit; 'tis that wherein we obtain Acceptance through the Aſſiſtance of his free Grace; and not that whereby we can be ſaid ſtrictly to merit, buy or purchaſe Salvation to our ſelves. For what's of Grace, is not of Debt, as from God to us; we are Debtors
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:152498:19"/>to him for Chriſt's ſake, but he is no Debtor to us in his Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Rewards: For we have all that's good, Root and Branch from him, who hath ordain'd Peace for us, having wrought all our works in us; and we are bound to give thanks to God always for what we have and are, even by his Grace and Goodneſs in Chriſt to us.</p>
            <p>§. XI.] Pr. Pag. 19. <hi>To believe and wait for the Life E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting after Death, is no Article of this</hi> Quakers <hi>Faith; this is a putting Salvation at a great Diſtance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is a foul Perverſion, as if I did not believe Life Everlaſting <hi>after Death;</hi> whereas I only detected <hi>R. G.</hi> his Miſtake on <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.28. his making the Believers looking for Chriſt and his Appearance the ſecond time without Sin to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, to be a hoping and waiting for Salvation <hi>after the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily Death;</hi> whereas I intended a Salvation from Sin, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently from Wrath, that this Salvation ought not to be put off till the Life to come. For all that truly know this Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Chriſt for this end, experience him to ſave them from Sin, and can truly ſay, <hi>Now is come Salvation and Strength, and the Kingdom of our God and the Power of his Chriſt,</hi> Rev. 12.</p>
            <p>Pr. p. 20. <hi>To affirm, that the Salvation of Sinners, yea, of the whole World, ſhould be compleatly finiſhed by Chriſt's Death upon the Croſs above Sixteen Hundred Years ſince, this is ſtrange Doctrine to this Ill principl'd</hi> Quaker.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> If the Salvation of the whole World was compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly finiſhed by Chriſt's Death on the Croſs ſo long ſince, what ſhould hinder any man of Salvation? And if ſo compleatly finiſh't, there is none like to miſs of it; let them be as Corrupt as they will in themſelves, there is no exception of Condition on Man's part. But if Salvation was ſo long ſince compleatly finiſhed for Sinners, yea, for the whole World, why does this Prieſt ſo Rail againſt me and the <hi>Quakers?</hi> He ſhould think by his own Rule, that we are compleatly ſaved as well as he. But if he ſays, that we want Faith, <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> and ſound Principles, and therefore are not ſaved, this ſtill confutes himſelf, and grants an inward work of Chriſt to produce Faith, <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> &amp;c.
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:152498:20"/>for the compleating our Salvation, although Chriſt dyed for all men.</p>
            <p>Pr. Ibid. <hi>You ſee clearly, its no part of this</hi> Quakers <hi>Faith to believe, that Chriſt is the Son of the Virgin</hi> Mary.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is an apparent Lye and groſs Perverſion; we have alwayes believed the Scriptures, even in this very matter of Chriſts being born of the Virgin.</p>
            <p>Pr. Ibid. <hi>This</hi> Quaker <hi>is bold to ſay to this Purpoſe, If any man believes, that Chriſt ſhall come at the laſt day to judge the quick and the dead, to adjudge the Righteous to Heaven, to condemn the Wicked to Hell, then he may look till his Eyes drop out, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> A Notorious Perverſion again; I ſaid nothing to this purpoſe againſt Chriſt's coming to judge the quick and dead at the Laſt Day, but againſt my Oppoſer's putting off Salvation till after the Bodily Death, in reference to that Appearance of Chriſt without Sin to Salvation to them that look for him, and this on <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.28. Upon which I ſaid, <q>'Tis ſtrange, that Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Sinners, yea, of the whole World, ſhould be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated at once above ſixteen hundred Years ſince, and yet to be ſo long after Death look't for, how long, is not known to thee, &amp;c. <hi>Nat. Chriſt.</hi> p. 29.</q> Here is not one word in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to Chriſt's coming to Judgment. But what was argued by me in this Caſe, was in reſpect to the Salvation of Sinners, and Chriſt's Appearance to ſave from <hi>Sin.</hi> For but in page be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I mentioned his <hi>Saving us by the Waſhing of Regeneration and Renewing of the holy Ghost</hi> on Tit. 3.4, 5, 6.</p>
            <p>Pr. p. 21. <hi>As for Chriſt's Righteouſneſs without us made ours by Faith, this is the Doctrine which is diſowned by this</hi> Papal Quaker.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is Falſe again: for whilſt we own a Life and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving by the Faith of the Son of God, how can we diſown his Righteouſneſs that is made our's by Faith? When 'tis made ours, we partake of it, though it was without us in him, before it was in us by him.</p>
            <p>§. XII.] Pr. Ibid. <hi>In this Quaking Account of Juſtification, what hath this</hi> Quaker <hi>ſaid more, which the Council of</hi> Trent <hi>hath
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:152498:20"/>not determined to his hand?</hi> viz. Council. Trid. <hi>Cap.</hi> 3. Seſſ 6. Cum ea renaſcentia per meritu paſſionis ejus, gratia, qua juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiunt, illis tribuatur (Which he thus Engliſheth) <hi>Together with the New Birth through the Merit of Chriſt's Paſſion, Grace, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they are made Righteous, is imparted to them. Cap.</hi> 7. Seſſ. 6. Juſtificatio eſt &amp; Sanctificatio &amp; Renovatio interioris hominis per voluntariam ſuſceptionem gratiae (As he interprets) <hi>Juſtification is both the Sanctification and Renovation of the inward man by Grace received.</hi> [He ſhould have ſaid, <hi>By the willing or free re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of Grace.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> And what does our Adverſary infer from hence, but that <hi>Quakers and Papiſts agree together in the point of Juſtification by inherent Righteouſneſs?</hi> And yet he cannot deny, but the Merit of Chriſt's Paſſion is confeſt to in the point. But it ſeems he would not have the New Birth concern'd in the caſe, or that Grace that makes us Righteous ſhould be imparted to us (and ſo included and joyned with the Merit of Chriſt's Paſſion in this great point of Juſtification) or that Juſtification ſhould be both the Sanctification and Renovation of the inward man by Grace received. If theſe be not offenſive to him, why does he clamour againſt the <hi>Quaker</hi> for agreeing with the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> in this point? as if his citing the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> having determin'd a point to the <hi>Quakers</hi> hand, or which <hi>Quakers</hi> own (though they never received it themſelves) and which he himſelf does not at all conſute, were enough to knock down the <hi>Quakers</hi> at one Blow. Whence it follows, that where the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> grants the Merit of Chriſt's Paſſion, which the Papiſts place mens firſt Juſtification upon without Works, Chriſt's Merit or deſerving herein muſt be oppoſed, becauſe the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> and <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts</hi> hold it. Is not this learned Logick? Thus our Adverſary has attempted to knock down the <hi>Quaker,</hi> becauſe the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> and <hi>Papiſts</hi> hold divers Errors (but <hi>Papiſts</hi> render their own good Works after the firſt Juſtification ſtrictly meritorious of Heaven, which the <hi>Quakers</hi> do not) therefore we muſt not hold any Truths, which they intermix among their Errors, but be brand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed &amp; derided for <hi>Papiſts, Papal Quakers;</hi> ſuch kind of arguing ſavours more of an <hi>Atheiſtical</hi> Spirit than of a <hi>Chriſtian.</hi> And
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:152498:21"/>ſuch meaſure have we from our Adverſary. But his main De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign is, to oppoſe the Saints being made Righteous by Grace im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted to them through Chriſt, and to impoſe upon us a Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, or rather his falſe Imputation thereof without either Sanctification or Renovation of the inward man by Grace recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, ſeeing he has eſpouſed the Cauſe of ſuch as affirm <hi>Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and Redemption of men, while no good is wrought in them,</hi> and that theſe are fulfilled or compleated WHOLLY WITH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>OUT THEM. And yet to his own Confutation has grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that Righteouſneſs muſt be <hi>imparted</hi> and <hi>retain'd</hi> (in his 10th page) but here becauſe the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> has confeſt unto <hi>the New Birth;</hi> and <hi>that the Grace that makes Righteous, muſt be imparted</hi> to them (rendring <hi>the Merit of Chriſt's Paſſion</hi> as a means thereof (which is an Undeniable Truth) I muſt be revil'd as a <hi>Papal Quaker,</hi> and this <hi>Inherent Righteouſneſs</hi> in the New Birth, though wrought by the Grace of God oppoſed, as to our Juſtification. Thus my Adverſary has not only Abſurdly argued againſt me, but <hi>Atheiſtically</hi> ſet himſelf againſt the Work of Chriſt <hi>inward,</hi> by invalidating of it, reckoning Perſons juſtified <hi>Wholly without</hi> (which muſt be) whilſt they are wholly Unjuſt and Poluted within, or <hi>when no good is wrought in them;</hi> elſe what does all his Quarrel againſt us amount to? But he ſillily goes on in his Compariſon between <hi>Quaker</hi> and <hi>Papiſt,</hi> as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</p>
            <p>Pr. Ibid. <hi>They do both diſclaim the works of the Law before Grace received.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ibid. <hi>Works not done in Chriſt the Seed do not juſtifie, ſays the Canting</hi> Quaker.</p>
            <p>Ibid. <hi>Juſtification is the Sanctifying of the inner man by Grace received, ſay the</hi> Papiſts.</p>
            <p>Ibid. <hi>The Righteouſneſs by Faith is when the Law is perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in us by the Works of the Spirit, ſaith the</hi> Quaker.</p>
            <p>Ibid. <hi>By Grace received in the New Birth, are we made Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, ſay the</hi> Papiſts. <hi>Thus the Light within, which guides the</hi> Quaker <hi>to Scribble concerning Juſtification, is nothing elſe but</hi> TRENT POPERY, <hi>infuſed into them by ſubtil Popiſh Prieſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> We have nothing but his Compariſon and Reviling
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:152498:21"/>here for Confutation. The matter is anſwered before: I would ask this man, <hi>Firſt,</hi> If he does not diſclaim the Works of the Law before Grace received? <hi>Secondly,</hi> If works not done in Chriſt do Juſtifie or render any Juſt? If he ſays, No, why does he Scoff and Cry out, <hi>Canting Quaker,</hi> ſo ſaying, they do not? <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Whether any do partake of the Righteouſneſs by Faith without Chriſt's fulfilling the Righteouſneſs of the Law <hi>in them,</hi> according to <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.4. For its <hi>them</hi> that are in Chriſt Jeſus, who walk not after the Fleſh but after the Spirit, to whom there is no Condemnation, and <hi>In</hi> whom the Righteouſneſs of the Law is fulfilled. And this does not make void Chriſt's Paſſion or Suffering for man, and fulfilling the Law in his Perſon without us; for therein he was not only a Perfect Pattern of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but alſo came to condemn ſin in the fleſh, and by his Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to make an Attonement and Pacification to ſtop the Wrath, and ſuſpend the ſevere Execution of the Law (which man had incurred) and to make way for Remiſſion to us, that we might be the more engaged to him to follow him in Spirit, and come under the New Covenant terms. But the Prieſt concludes with a notorious Falſhood about what we write of Juſtification, <hi>as being infuſed by Popiſh Priests.</hi> This is a Wicked Slander, for the work of the New Birth Being made inwardly Righteous by Grace received in Chriſt, the ſanctifying &amp; renewing the inner man by the holy Spirit; theſe we never learned of the Popiſh Prieſts, nor ever were we diſcipled by them, but by the bleſſed operation of the Spirit of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, through Faith in his Name, according to the Teſtimony of himſelf &amp; holy Apoſtles moſt plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intimated in theſe Scriptures, <hi>Except a man be born again, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee the Kingdom of God. Except a man be born of Water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God,</hi> John 3.3, 5. And, <hi>If I waſh thee not, thou haſt no part with me,</hi> ſaid Chriſt to <hi>Peter,</hi> John 13.8. And, <hi>According to his Mercy he ſaved us by the Waſhing of Regeneration,</hi> &amp;c. Tit. 3.5, 6. And alſo, ſee 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.11. where both Waſhing, Sanctification and Juſtification are ſaid to be in the Name of the Lord Jeſus, and by the Spirit of our God. And even <hi>Eraſmus</hi> in his <hi>Paraphraſe,</hi> on <hi>Acts</hi> 13.38, 39. ſaith expreſly, <q>
                  <hi>Through this ſame Jeſus each man,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:152498:22"/>without reſpect of any Perſon, or elſe offence, hath Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or Juſtification and Innocency profferred unto him, ſo that he believe the Promiſes of the Goſpel.</hi>
               </q> Note, Surely then theſe are profferred to be received. Therefore this Adverſary's ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>That the</hi> Quakers <hi>have a P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Theſe are ſome of his Abominable Scurrilous Slanders; ſuch Temporizers as he are more like to have a <hi>Pope in their Bellies,</hi> that for their <hi>Bellies</hi> can Temporize, Change and <hi>Turn their Coat</hi> in Religious matters. And how like a <hi>Popiſh In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendiary</hi> has he acted, in rendring the People called <hi>Quakers</hi> ſo guilty of Popery, as if he had a Deſign to carry on for the Popiſh Intereſt, either by endeavouring the <hi>Quakers</hi> Deſtruction, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of their oppoſition to Popery, or elſe by encreaſing the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of <hi>Papiſts</hi> by adding the <hi>Quakers</hi> thereto; or rather falſly rendring the Popiſh Intereſt far bigger than it is. Beſides, he groſly miſtakes, as well as ſhallowly argues about <hi>Popery,</hi> in his rendring ſome Truths, which the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> held to be <hi>Popery;</hi> whereas <hi>Popery is the Groſs, Erronious, Idolatrous and Superſtitious part of their Doctrine and Religion,</hi> and not any Scripture-Truths that they hold. But this man, it ſeems, where they hold the <hi>New Birth</hi> and the <hi>Renovation</hi> of the inner man, &amp;c. as neceſſary to our Juſtification, this he'll deem <hi>Popery,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe held by the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But further, Though Chriſt dyed for all, all are not Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the bleſſed Ends and Benefit thereof, but thoſe to whom it is communicated; for, unleſs in <hi>Adam</hi> they were faln and degenerate, ſo as to dye (in their own Injuſtice) unto Righteouſneſs, they ſhould not be unjuſt; ſo unleſs they be regenerate in Chriſt, they ſhould never be juſtified and live to him.</p>

            <p>What <hi>Proteſtant</hi> ever denyed this? that only the Regenerate had the Benefit of Chriſt's Sufferings, and that Regeneration

                  <hi>That Almighty God hath given Power to his Miniſters to declare and pronounce to his People, being penitent; the Abſolution and Remiſſion of their Sius, he pardons and abſolves all them which truly repent and unfeignedly believe, &amp;c.

            <p>And alſo let it be noted, how Inconſiſtent our preſent Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary is with the Sermon preached before the Lords in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon the Faſt day, <hi>February</hi> 4. 1673. by <hi>Herbert</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Hereford,</hi> where after he has exclaimed againſt the <hi>Vice De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchery, Pride and Luxury, the abominable Luſt, Exceſs and Superfluities</hi> of our Times, he earneſtly preſſeth and urgeth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Conſciences <q>
                  <hi>For Humiliation, Weeping, Mourning, Faſting, mortifying their Carnal Beſtial Luſt, that ſo God from his Mercy-ſeat might look down with Compaſſion upon them, and pardon all their Crying Sins; and then God would Bleſs them,</hi>
               </q> &amp;c. Here he did not preach Pardon, Peace, Bleſſing or Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to them, if they continued in Sin. And further plainly ſaith, <q>
                  <hi>Now that Sin is more hateful unto Chriſt than any Sufferings is evident, becauſe he endureth all theſe to take away Sin. Chriſt could endure the greateſt Torment in the World, but cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the leaſt Sin; for Sin is not only hateful, but a flat Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction unto God: for God is Holineſs. Can we be ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful Beaſts, ſuch ſavage Wolves, ſuch cruel Tygers, ſuch bloody Monſters, as yet to crucify him afreſh, and put him again to open ſhame? God forbid!

               <hi>Anſw.</hi> In all theſe this Envious Prieſt hath moſt ſhamefully abus'd and perverted my Words, as may apparently be ſeen in the Book, Entituled, <hi>The Nature of Chriſtianity,</hi> &amp;c. pag. 40, and 41.</p>
            <p>As <hi>Firſt,</hi> About <hi>No Hoſanna;</hi> a falſhood. For I confeſs'd that the multitude cried, <hi>Hoſanna to the Son of</hi> David, Matth. 21.9. And ask'd, if <hi>Hoſanna</hi> be not, <hi>Save now, I beſeech thee?</hi> only I ſhewed <hi>R.

But yet that there is an higher Expreſſion of Honour to him with reſpect to his Deity, and as the Eternal Son of God, and <hi>David's</hi> Lord, according to his own Teſtimony, when he queſtioned the <hi>Phariſees</hi> and <hi>Scribes,</hi> who called him the <hi>Son of David,</hi> viz. <hi>What think ye of Chriſt, whoſe Son is he? They ſaid unto him, The Son of</hi> David: <hi>He ſaid unto them, How then doth</hi> David <hi>in Spirit call him Lord, ſaying, The Lord ſaid unto my Lord, Sit thou on my Right Hand, till I make thine Enemies thy Foot-ſtool? If</hi> David <hi>then call him Lord, how is he his Son? And no man was able to anſwer him a Word, neither durſt any man (from that day forth) ask any more Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> Mat. 22. and Mark 12.35, 36, 37. Did Chriſt herein deny himſelf to be the Son of <hi>David,</hi> or of his Seed according to the Fleſh? no ſure; no more have we. What I writ as before was in relation to the Honour due to Chriſt, as the Eternal Son of God, which the <hi>Phariſees</hi> allow'd not of, though they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed him to be <hi>the Son of David,</hi> but were offended at his owning himſelf <hi>to be the Son of God,</hi> John 10.36. and 19.7. The <hi>Jews</hi> charged him <hi>with Blaſphemy,</hi> and ſaid, <hi>He ought to dye becauſe thereof.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Prieſt has moſt ſhamefully belyed me, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:152498:24"/>upon me <hi>a denial of the Deity of Jeſus Chriſt, as if I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied him to be God our Saviour,</hi> which is a groſs Lye; for I have in plain words confeſt, that the holy Prophets, Apoſtles and Miniſters pointed and teſtified unto Jeſus Chriſt <hi>both as Man born of the Virgin, to his coming in the Fleſh,
<note place="margin">Nat. Chri. pag. 40.</note> and unto his Divinity and manifeſtation in Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Prieſt hath abominably belyed me in charging this Doctrine upon me, that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt is not the Son of the Subſtance of the Father</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo he ſets down in his 10th Article as the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers belief,</hi> p. 147.</note> whenas I have plainly confeſt his Divinity, and the main drift of my Diſcourſe is, that he may be chiefly honour'd and worſhipped, as in reſpect to <hi>his Deity, Divine Power and Glory, as the Eternal Son of God.</hi> For that <hi>Hoſanna,</hi> and <hi>Adoration</hi> &amp; Claim of Salvation, which ſome pretend <hi>only</hi> to Chriſt as the <hi>Son of Mary,</hi> or to him as the Son of <hi>Mary only,</hi> this I was not ſatisfied with, becauſe it excludes his Divinity from that honour chiefly due thereto.

<note place="margin">Mark 6.3.</note> that they who called <hi>Chriſt the Carpenter; the Son of Mary,</hi> (and were offended at him) did not ſhew that <hi>honour and reſpect</hi> to him, that <hi>Peter</hi> did, who ſaid,

               <hi>Thou art Chriſt the Son of the living God,</hi> though this can be no Denial <hi>of his outward Birth of the Virgin.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Pr.</hi> pag. 26. <hi>They deny, that the Son of</hi> Mary <hi>is to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped as God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> We do not divide Chriſt, though we diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his <hi>Godhead</hi> and <hi>Manhood,</hi> viz.

What conceit and Apprehenſion of God ſhould we have then, when we come to call upon his Name? We may not conceive him under any Corporal Shape, for he is a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and therefore they that think, they may Worſhip the Humanity of Chriſt diſ-joyned, are deceived: We are not to Worſhip it as ſeparated from his Diety.</hi> [Thus far <hi>Preſton.</hi>]</p>
            <p>Pr. Ibid. <hi>To call</hi> Mary <hi>the Mother of God, is a Popiſh ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, not Scripture-Language: In this Quaking Diſcourſe the Learned may obſerve many old Hereſies revived—This</hi> Quaker's <hi>ugly Doctrine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is the man, that has been upbrading the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> ſo much with Popery, who himſelf now ſo much embraces their Language and Doctrine, that he is offended at me for ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, It is not Scripture-Language.

He has it up as an Article of the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers unſound Faith,</hi> to ſay, <hi>That</hi> Mary <hi>is not the Mother of God,</hi> and that 'tis Popery <hi>to call</hi> Mary <hi>the Mother of God</hi> (in his <hi>Art.</hi> 10. p. 147.) and counts the <hi>Quakers Light within to be very D<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>LL-SIGHTED, that it cannot diſcern</hi> Mary <hi>to be the MOTHER OF GOD,</hi> p. 26.

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The firſt part of this Paſſage is a frequent reiterated Falſhood, to ſay, <hi>'Tis againſt my Light within, or in my Eye Popery, to call Jeſus Chriſt the Son of</hi> Mary, according to the Fleſh; for he was Miraculouſly conceived by the holy Ghoſt overſhadowing her, and born of her. But I muſt confeſs, I like not the phraſe, <hi>Mary the Mother of God;</hi> nor do I think it would be ſeaſonable or effectual ſo to preach the Eternal God (that made all Things) to <hi>Indians</hi> and <hi>Heathens</hi> under ſuch a Character, as having a Woman whom he made, to be his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: How many <hi>Turks</hi> or <hi>Infidels</hi> will they convince or convert to <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> by telling them of the <hi>Mother of God?</hi> Nay, do they not hereby rather lay a ſtumbling-block in their way? I do not think, that the Papiſts themſelves would have more reviled and ranted againſt us, than this Prieſt has done, for but ſaying, to be ſure, <hi>it is not Scripture-Language,</hi> to call <hi>Mary the MOTHER of God,</hi> crying out, <hi>Deluded</hi> Quakers, <hi>the</hi> Papiſts <hi>not ſo groſly deceived.</hi> Now he is wheel'd about to the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> other while Ranting and Tearing againſt them, like a Whifling Braſh and Boaſter. Before, he would beat us down, as no better then rank Papiſts, for holding ſomething determined in the Council of <hi>Tront</hi> about <hi>Juſtification and Renovation of the inner man,</hi> as if he needed no other Argument to knock us down, but <hi>the Council of</hi> Trent <hi>holds it,</hi> viz. The New Birth, Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, <hi>Renewing</hi> the <hi>inner man, by Grace received,</hi> as neceſſary to our Juſtification, or conſtituting of us truly <hi>Righteous</hi> in Chriſt. And why may not this Prieſt rather be deem'd a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> or one as ready for their <hi>Ave-Maria,</hi> as he was for the <hi>Common
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:152498:26"/>Prayer</hi> when he turn'd his Coat, whilſt he is ſo fiercely contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for their Unſcriptural Phraſe before-cited? But then to mend the matter, he limits <hi>Mary</hi>'s <hi>being the Mother of God</hi> to the <hi>Son,</hi> according <hi>to his Man-hood,</hi> pag. 26.

And for a mediate Call, I deny that they have it from the holy Apoſtles or primitive Church of Chriſt in their dayes.</p>
            <p>Pr. pag. 31. <hi>Here little Children are taught to look upon all Teaching Prieſts as ſo many Deceivers, as thoſe Hirelings that preach for Money and Tythes, which is a Lying Slander.</hi>

            <p>Pr. Ibid. <hi>According to the baſeneſs of theſe Quaking Lines its a ſhame for the King's ſacred Majeſty, the Defender of the true Faith, that ſuch baſe Prieſts ſhould be owned by him.</hi>

And rather than not have their Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous Ends anſwered, they'l throw a Man in Goal for the Value of a Tythe-Pig; they are ſo cruel and hard-hearted, many of them, that they value a few Tythe-Piggs more than they do Mens Liberties or Lives.

The Law and Teſtimony, as given by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and as in Tables of Stone were a Rule to <hi>Iſrael</hi> after the Fleſh (yet not to exclude the Word nigh them, even in their Hearts, or their hearkening to the Voice of God, for that was through all Diſpenſations) The Law and Teſtimony of the New Covenant, written in the Hearts of ſpiritual Chriſtians, under the Guidance of the holy Spirit, muſt needs be their Rule now, who Worſhip God in Spirit. And further, the <hi>Commandment</hi> which is <hi>a Lamp,</hi> and the <hi>Law</hi> which is <hi>Light,</hi> and the <hi>Teſtimony of Jeſus</hi> which is the <hi>Spirit of Prophecy,</hi> are not only the Principal Rule in the Hearts of Spiritual Chriſtians (who are the Evangelical <hi>Iſrael</hi> and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>Jews</hi>) but alſo of more Univerſal extent as to Nations then the Scriptures are.

So that the Scripture could not be their Rule who had it not, but the Law and Light of God and his Chriſt in their Hearts. And the Law and the Teſtimony within contain the Subſtance and Truth of what's written in Scripture, and will the more clearly and livingly appear, and be read in the Heart, as the Vail of Darkneſs, Sin and Corruption in man is removed and taken away in his Converſion and coming into the New Covenant Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

            <p>As for our Meeting, which he Scornfully terms <hi>Dumb;</hi> we therein wait upon God in his holy Fear, and have regard to the Motions of his good Spirit in his Worſhip and Service, both in our inward Attention, Meditation, Souls breathings unto God, Preaching, Praying to, and Praiſing our God, who is a Spirit and to be Worſhipped in Spirit &amp; Truth. I take his telling of <hi>the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the Hat</hi> alſo to be in Scorn and Contempt, &amp; nothing at all of any ſerious Sence or Argument in it; he ſhould have explain'd himſelf therein.</p>

               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I think this Prieſt hath Reflected on the King and his Clergy to purpoſe, while he has rendred them ſuch, as do not pray with the Spirit, or as cannot pray without Book; for ſuch was our Friend writing of, about which this Prieſt takes all this occaſion. And why does he call the King <hi>a Nurſing-Father of the Church?</hi> He rather means, as he would have him, the Nurſing-Father of the Clergy, that they may feed upon the <hi>Fat,</hi> live upon <hi>Tythes and Forced Maintenance, Impriſon and Spoil ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:152498:33"/>Innocent Subjects,</hi> that the Lofty, Domineering Prieſts may live in Pride and Fulneſs; which thing, doubtleſs, can be no De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light nor Advantage to the King, that the Prieſts ſhould thus harraſs and deſtroy his Subjects, conſidering his divers Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for Liberty of Conſcience and Toleration. But if the King ſhould grant and cauſe a Law to be made to leave People free to their Conſciences and Perſwaſions in that Caſe of Payment or Non-payment of Tythes, then I ſuppoſe this Prieſt would not ſo readily cry up the King as the Churches Nurſing-Father. What the Prophet ſaith, <hi>That Kings ſhall be thy Nurſing-Fathers, and their Queens thy Nurſing-Mothers,</hi> relates not at all to any Perſecuting Church or Prieſt-hood, but to God's own afflicted People, <hi>Zion,</hi> or Church of Chriſt in the Reſtoration and Gathering of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> thereunto, to whom he ſaith, <hi>Thy Deſtroyers, and they that made thee Waſte, ſhall go forth of thee,</hi> Iſa. 49.17. So that when ſuch <hi>Perſecutors</hi> and <hi>Deſtroyers</hi> (as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Prieſts are) come to be removed, and the Hearts of Kings and Princeſſes come to be made tender by the Inviſible Power of God, they ſhall be a Comfort as Nouriſhers and Relievers of God's afflicted People from their Oppreſſions, when the Beaſt ſhall hate the Whore and lay her Deſolate, that ſhe may no longer perſecute nor drink the Blood of the Saints. So that this Prophecy of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> Chap. 49.23. does not appertain to a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting and Oppreſſing Prieſt-hood or Church, but to the Afflicted and Oppreſſed <hi>Zion</hi> and People of God in the Day of his Churches Reſtoration and encreaſe, even among the <hi>Gentiles.</hi>

As in the caſe of <hi>Mordecai;</hi> the reaſon he renders for his not bowing to proud <hi>Haman</hi> in his ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Appeal to God, as we have it in the 13th of <hi>Eſther</hi> (in <hi>Apoc.</hi>) his words are theſe; <hi>Thou knoweſt all things, and thou knoweſt Lord, that it was neither of Malice nor Preſumption, nor for any deſire of Glory, that I did this, and not bow down to proud</hi>

As <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid to <hi>Cornelius, Stand up, for even I my ſelf am a Man,</hi> Acts 10.26 (as much as to ſay, This Bowing or Homage belongs not to me, but to God) Its ſaid in <hi>Eſther</hi> the third, <hi>All the King's Servants that were at the King's Gate bowed their Knees, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verenced</hi> Haman; <hi>for the King had ſo commanded concerning him.

And in our Meeting on the <hi>Firſt Day</hi> of the Week, as the Primitive Chriſtians did, we do not ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitiouſly obſerve the Day, or place an Eſteem or Sanctity upon that day, ſimply conſider'd, more than others, but obſerve it to the Lord. The Apoſtle did not impoſe the Obſervation of Days upon the Primitive Chriſtians, nor were they to judge one another in that matter. One man eſteemeth one day above an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other; another eſteemeth every day alike: Let every man be fully perſwaded in his own mind: He that regardeth the day re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardeth it unto the Lord, &amp;c. ſee <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.4, 5, 6.</p>

               <hi>Anſw.</hi> That which the Prieſt calls the <hi>Corrupt Teſtimony,</hi> is according to Chriſt and his holy Apoſtles Teſtimony.

And to have the being of ſin de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed by Chriſt, is not to be Righteous over-much in this World; for 'tis for this End, that Chriſt is made manifeſt to take away our ſins, <hi>and to deſtroy the Works of the Devil,</hi> 1 Joh. 3. Chriſt deſtroying the Works of the Devil, is to deſtroy the <hi>being of Sin,</hi> that it may neither Rule nor be in true Believers.

For what can dark minds, and Earthly Corrupt Hearts, or Natural men by their own Wiſdom truly underſtand of holy Scripture? 'tis as a ſeal'd Book unto them.

               <hi>Teach me thy Statutes, make me to underſtand the Way of thy Precepts; ſo ſhall I talk of thy wondrous Works.

            <p>§. XXIV.] In the next place, the Prieſt appears greatly vex't at <hi>James Parnel</hi>'s Book, called, <hi>The Trumpet of the Lord blown;</hi> or, <hi>A Blast againſt Pride and Oppreſſion.</hi> About which the Prieſt greatly abuſes the Author, and the people called <hi>Qrs.</hi> moſt ſhamefully perverting his Teſtimony againſt <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion,</hi> as may plainly appear in a few Inſtances. As:</p>
            <p>Whereas <hi>James Parnel</hi> ſaith, Wo unto you, that are called <hi>Lords and Ladies, Knights, &amp;c. in reſpect to your Perſons,</hi> who are <hi>Exalted in the Earth, who are Proud, High and Lofty,</hi> &amp;c. With other paſſages, Threatning and Warning of them for their <hi>Pride, Wantonneſs, Voluptuouſneſs,</hi> &amp;c. inſtancing <hi>Dives, Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, Pharaoh, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pr.</hi> Hereupon the Prieſt ſaith, <hi>According to this</hi> Qr. <hi>the laſt End of all the aforeſaid Perſons, without exception, is to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed,</hi> p. 70. <hi>And that according to this Quaking Scrible, all that are called Lords, Ladies, Knights, Gentlemen and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>women, Maſter, Miſtreſs, Madam, ſhall every one of them, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they turn</hi> Quakers, <hi>be damn'd forever; they ſhall without any Exception be caſt into Hell,</hi> p. 71.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Prieſts horrid and groſs Abuſe in theſe Paſſages, in ſaying, <hi>that without any Exception they ſhall be all caſt into Hell.</hi> Here he makes the Threat Abſolute, as if becauſe they are called <hi>Lords and Ladies,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>they muſt all be damned in the</hi> Qrs. <hi>ſence;</hi>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:152498:44"/>which is a moſt Sordid Perverſion and Knavery, leaving out much that concerns their Deſtructive Ways and States, and the very Principal Condition or Matter which <hi>J. P.</hi> inſerted in thoſe Threats and Warnings of his: and yet for all this the Prieſt puts in or Forges a Condition or Exception in his own Terms, <hi>That unleſs they turn</hi> Qrs. <hi>they ſhall be damned forever.</hi> Theſe are none of <hi>J.P</hi>'s words, and yet a forged Exception enough to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Prieſt Contradictory to himſelf.</p>
            <p>And it is to be noted, that this Prieſt in his Citation, pag. 71. out of <hi>James Parnel</hi>'s Book, pag. 31, 32, 33. which he takes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, he hath left out the moſt Materal Paſſages, both rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to thoſe Ways and States that are Deſtructive, and to thoſe Conditions that tend to Salvation. As for Inſtance: After the Words, <hi>Riſing up to Play,</hi> the Prieſt leaves out, <hi>and live in Pride and Covetouſneſs.</hi> And after the words, <hi>The blind eads the blind into the Ditch,</hi> he leaves out, <hi>and ſo you lead your Lives, and ſpend your Time here, and think to be ſaved hereafter: No, no.</hi> And after the words, <hi>We is coming upon you all,</hi> he leaves out, <hi>who are Proud; you muſt all give an Account before the Lord God of Heaven and Earth, who is Terrible to the Wicked. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, the Day of the Lord cometh, which will burn as an Oven, and all that are Proud, and all that do Wickedly, ſhall be as Stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi> Thus far J.P. And next after theſe words; <hi>The Lord abhors all your Profeſſion and your Hypocriſie,</hi> the Prieſt leaves out theſe, viz. <hi>It is not Profeſſion that he ſeeks for; it is Practice: it is not the Sayer, but the Doer that ſhall inherit: it is not all that ſay, Lord, Lord, that ſhall inherit; but he that doth the Will of my Father—The Lord looks for Fruits,</hi> &amp;c. And next after theſe words, <hi>You ſerve the Devil with your Hearts and Actions,</hi> the Prieſt leaves out, <hi>who is King of Pride; and here you are in the broad and caſie Way, in the firſt Nature, which is in the Fall, ſeparated from God, whoſe Kingdom is not of this World.</hi> Thus far J. P.</p>
            <p>See now, how plain it is that <hi>J. Parnel</hi> does not threaten them with Deſtruction or Hell without Exception, or meerly for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing called, <hi>Lords, Ladies, Knights, Gentlemen, Gemlewomen, Madam, &amp;c.</hi> but plainly ſhews them the Deſtruction and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:152498:44"/>that thoſe Evil Courſes, Ways and Practices (which too many live in) lead to; and that they that live or continue in Pride and Covetouſneſs, cannot eſcape Deſtruction, is Evident: For without Converſion there is no Salvation. Again, how plain that J.P. propoſeth the Conditions, that God requireth in order to a Reformation, and conſequently the Salvation of the ſame perſons, whom he Warns in theſe words, viz. <hi>The Lord abhors your Hypocriſie; 'tis not Profeſſion that he ſeeks for, 'tis Practice: it is not the Sayer, but the Doer that ſhall inherit — The Lord looks for Fruits</hi> (as before cited.)</p>
            <p>Again, the Prieſt, p. 73. in his Citation out of <hi>James Parnel</hi>'s Book, p. 34, 35, 36. he leaves out, <hi>Let your Mouthes be ſtopt, all you who act in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrighteouſneſs.</hi> And next after the words, <hi>Away with all your Profeſſion,</hi> he leaves out, <hi>and now Repent;</hi> and then follows, <hi>Tremble before the Lord:</hi> and then he alſo leaves out, <hi>Come down, all you High and Lofty Ones:</hi> and then follows, <hi>Howl in Sack-cloth and Aſhes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And after the words (p. 34.) <hi>Who are for the Fire,</hi> the Prieſt leaves out theſe, viz. <hi>For Fruit he is come to ſeek for. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore profeſs him no longer in words, but now</hi> Repent <hi>and Return from all your <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrighteouſneſs: for know you not, that no <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Perſon ſhall inherit the Kingdom of God, No Vain Perſon, nor Drunkards, Swearers, no Lyar, no Proud, no Covetous ones, none who delight in Pleaſures, Sporting, Rioting, Chambering and Wantonneſs, no <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nholy, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nclean Thing muſt enter.</hi> Thus far <hi>James Parnel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now let all ſerious Readers judge, how baſely and fallaciouſly the Prieſt hath dealt with <hi>J. Parnel</hi> and the <hi>Qrs.</hi> on his Account, to render him as Pronouncing Abſolute Sentence of <hi>Damnation for evermore upon all that are called,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 74.</note> Lords, Ladies, Knights, Gentlemen, <hi>&amp;c.
<note place="margin">Pag. 75.</note> as dooming them all without Exception to the Fire of Hell,</hi> pag. 75. And not only ſo, but the Prieſt has forged this as an <hi>Article</hi> of the <hi>Qrs.</hi> Faith, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Article</hi> 45. <hi>We</hi> Qrs. <hi>do believe, That all that are called Lords, Ladies, Knights, Gentlemen and Gentlewomen, Maſter, Miſtreſs, Madam, are all accurſed of God, and ſhall be caſt into Hell;
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:152498:45"/>and that they are no better, nor ſhall fare better then</hi> Lucifer, Dives, Haman, Pharaoh, Herod, <hi>and the reſt of their Fore-Fathers,</hi> pag. 154.</p>
            <p>And to this very purpoſe he has forged Three Lying Articles in the <hi>Qrs.</hi> Name, <hi>viz.</hi> his 45<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, 46<hi rend="sup">th</hi> &amp; 47<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Article. Wherefore I teſtifie againſt this Prieſt, as an Arrant Forger, and one that has dealt moſt Baſely and Knaviſhly with our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed Friend's Teſtimony herein. For in the reading of his Books he could not be Ignorant, <hi>Firſt,</hi> That it was the ſtate of <hi>Dives, Haman,</hi> &amp;c. and thoſe that continued therein, that were liable to their End, to wit, Deſtruction; and that they that live in theſe Evils, Pride, Covetouſneſs, Oppreſſion, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, &amp;c. do incur Deſtruction.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That our Friend warned them all (to wit, the Great Ones, with the Prieſts and People) to <hi>Repent and to Return from all their <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrighteouſneſs,</hi> &amp;c. But this the Prieſt was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to leave out and take no notice of, that he might render the <hi>Qrs.</hi> more Odious, and incenſe the great Ones againſt them as guilty of great <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncharitableneſs, Religious Foolery, Melancholly,</hi> &amp;c. &amp; ſays, <hi>becauſe they are not Trembling</hi> Qrs <hi>they muſt all to Hell, Mind this Melancholly</hi> Qr. <hi>how he hath packt them up for Hell,</hi> pag. 73. We may rather ſay, Mind this Deceitful, Scornful Prieſt, that has thus forged and play'd the Knave, and fordidly abuſed the plain Teſtimonies and ſerious Warnings of a deceaſed Servant of the Lord; and then Scoff, at <hi>Trembling.</hi> But the Day will come, that the <hi>Fearfulneſs</hi> and <hi>Horror,</hi> that will ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize ſuch <hi>Hypocrites, Atheiſtical</hi> Spirits and Abuſers of Truth and Religion, will cauſe him to <hi>Tremble</hi> and <hi>Quake,</hi> and his Reward will be according to his Works, and the Glorying of ſuch in Wickedneſs will be their ſhame. Its time for this <hi>Hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Scornful</hi> Prieſt to Repent: <hi>J. Parnel</hi>'s plain Teſtimonies and Warnings, both to High and Low, without reſpect of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, ſhall riſe up in Judgment againſt this <hi>Temporizing, Dau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing, Flattering</hi> Prieſt, that hath ſo <hi>foully</hi> and <hi>ſhamefully</hi> abuſed and perverted them, to incenſe the Powers againſt us, like one of <hi>Jeroboam</hi>'s Prieſts againſt the Lord's Prophet; ſee <hi>Amos</hi> 7.10, 13. even in as great Envy as <hi>Amaziah</hi> ſhewed againſt

            <p>§ XXV.] Whereas the Prieſt is offended at <hi>J. Parnel</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhing between the <hi>Letter</hi> and the <hi>Life,</hi> as between the <hi>Shadow</hi> and the <hi>Subſtance,</hi> p. 70, 71.

            <p>Whereupon I ask him, if the Apoſtle doth not diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Letter</hi> and the <hi>Spirit</hi> in theſe Scriptures, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.6. <hi>That we ſhould ſerve in Newneſs of the</hi> Spirit, <hi>and not in the Old<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the</hi> Letter.

And whether no part of the Scripture or <hi>Writing</hi> of <hi>Moſes</hi> or any elſe, was intended in this term <hi>Letter?</hi> But conſider all Scripture as it ſignifies <hi>Writing,</hi> ought there not to be a diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on made not only between the <hi>Writing</hi> and the <hi>matter written,</hi> but much more between the <hi>Writing</hi> and the <hi>Spirit, Life</hi> or <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance</hi> declared of in the Writing?</p>
            <p>Concerning <hi>Baptiſm</hi> he defends his practice very poorly (whilſt he intends Baptizing or rather <hi>Sprinkling young Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi>) in his telling us, <hi>That the Church of</hi> England <hi>is groſly miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken; this</hi> Quakers <hi>Doctrine hath</hi> Quaked <hi>the Doctrine of the
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:152498:46"/>Church of</hi> England <hi>into a meer deluſion,</hi> p. 78. And why ſo? but becauſe the <hi>Quaker</hi> ſaith, <q>The <hi>Baptiſm</hi> we own, is the <hi>Baptiſm of Chriſt:</hi> there is but <hi>one Lord, one Faith, one Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm,</hi>

                  <hi>Although ſenſe tell thee 'tis Bread, yet it is the Body; let Faith confirm thee, judge not by Senſe; after the words of our Lord let no doubt riſe in thy mind of the Verity of</hi> Fleſh <hi>and</hi> Blood <hi>there is no place to doubt,</hi> &amp;c.</q> See how exactly our Adverſary agrees with theſe <hi>Papiſts,</hi> in ſaying, <hi>The Bread broken is the Body of Chriſt,</hi> as before.

For there is an Inward and Spiritual Supper of the Lord, as well as there was an outward, which they partake of who hear the Voice of the Son of God, and open the Door of their Heart un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, that he may come in and Sup with them and they with him, according to his Teſtimony in <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.20.

J. P.</hi> p. 78, 79.</q> Hence its evident, that he did not term the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Duſt,</hi> but the Hireling Prieſts <hi>ſtudied Brain-Notions</hi> or Knowledge.</p>
            <p>Whereas the Prieſt appears in a great Rage and in Cruel Mockery againſt <hi>J. Fernel,</hi> for his plain dealing with the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:152498:47"/>Heads and Prieſts of <hi>England;</hi> as where J.

               </q> J. P. pag. 80.</p>
            <p>As alſo where he ſaith, <q>We own <hi>Magiſtracy</hi> in its place; for whilſt there is <hi>Tranſgreſſion,</hi> there muſt be a <hi>Law,</hi> and while the <hi>Devil</hi> hath Power over Man, there will be <hi>Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion.</hi> The <hi>Law</hi> was given forth to curb <hi>Evil-doers,</hi> &amp;c.

            </p>
            <p>Theſe Paſſages the Prieſt has left out in his Citation, except the firſt Line; and then goes on citing, viz. <hi>They neither know how to rule or govern, who are guided by their own Wills, ſuch rule with partiality and reſpect of Perſons, and give forth Laws in their own Wills, Perſecute the Righteous, encourage the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then,</hi> &amp;c.

            <p>Pr. <hi>There are neither Heads of</hi> England <hi>nor</hi> Miniſters, <hi>whom the</hi> Quakers <hi>own; both the</hi> Magiſtrates <hi>and known</hi> Miniſtry <hi>of</hi> England <hi>are abſolutely denied by all through-paced</hi> Quakers, p. 81.

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> All which are invective, malicious and abominable Slanders and falſe Inferences, ſhewing a very Cruel and Bloody mind in this Prieſt. Be it noted ſtill, that <hi>J.

<pb n="81" facs="tcp:152498:47"/>was among the then <hi>Rulers</hi> and <hi>Heads</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> who were highly guilty of Perſecuting the Innocent in thoſe days, and that this was in the time of the former Powers, in <hi>Cromwell</hi>'s time, before the King's Return. For 'tis above Twenty Years ago ſince <hi>J. Parnel</hi> dyed in Priſon in <hi>Colcheſter Caſtle</hi> for his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience and Teſtimony. Therefore, be it now obſerv'd, that this <hi>Malicious</hi> Prieſt ſhews himſelf mad againſt thoſe Teſtimonies which were really given forth in Reproof to thoſe Corrupt, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting <hi>Rulers,</hi> who acted in <hi>O.

How like a Revengeful <hi>Temporizer</hi> has this Prieſt ſhewn himſelf to incenſe the Preſent <hi>Government</hi> againſt us, for ſuch plain Teſtimonies againſt the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of <hi>O.

Thus the Prieſt has over-ſhot himſelf in his <hi>Envy, Cruelty</hi> and <hi>Out-rage.</hi> But I would yet ask him, If it be not poſſible for <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>Rulers</hi> to commit any Offences againſt God?

            <p>Note, that the occaſion the Prieſt takes thus to charge the <hi>Qrs.</hi> Light within,
<note place="margin">Obſervation.</note> is upon a Book of Warnings and Letters ſent to <hi>Oliver</hi> and <hi>Richard Cromwel</hi> by <hi>G.

B. has now no need of that to be ſure) But ſuppoſing the Paſſages he takes Occaſion at, to be as Offenſive, as with any Colour of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon he can make or render them (making the worſt he can of them) You may ſee what Loyalty this Prieſt ſhews to the King and preſent Government, in going about to render a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, (who are free-born <hi>Engliſh</hi> men, and peaceable Subjects) Obnoxious to the Government, Diſloyal and Rebellious on ſuch a particular occaſion, telling us,
<note place="margin">Pag. 138, 139.</note> that <hi>their tender Conſciences had no feeling of Rebellion and Treaſon,</hi> and now charging the <hi>Qrs</hi> Light within <hi>with acting the part of Diſloyalty, Rebellion and high Treaſon againſt the King's Sacred Majeſty.</hi> Alſo in his writing againſt <hi>Edw.

Cromwel</hi>'s Day, and for telling them, <hi>the Lord would cut them off</hi> (wherein he truly foretold their Down-fall) This alſo the Prieſt takes notice of, both in his 132, 133, &amp; 134th pages, and alſo makes it an Article of the <hi>Qrs.</hi> Faith, <hi>Art.</hi> 90. to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der us Odious to the preſent Rulers; for hee's not ſo honeſt as
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:152498:50"/>to tell them it concern'd <hi>Cromwel</hi> (when <hi>Protector</hi>) and his Greatures or Agents (not to excuſe any Corrupt Rulers now) Thus like a moſt Envious Forger and Perverter the Prieſt has treated us. And ſuppoſing he had real occaſion againſt ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in G. B's Warnings or Letters aforeſaid, yet how mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly hath he Violated the Act of Indemnity, and herein ſhewn himſelf moſt Uncharitable and Unchriſtian; and yet he is the man that pretendeth to ſo much Charity and Chriſtianity. He counts it Uncharitable to put <hi>black Names</hi> (as he calls them) up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Perſons, and ſaith, <hi>that Chriſtian Charity thinks no Evil, and Chriſtianity speaks Evil of no man,</hi> pag. 113. But he has ſhewn himſelf ſo much void both of this Charity and this Chriſtianity, that he both thinks Evil, ſpeaks Evil and acts Wickedly againſt many in his writing thus maliciouſly, not only againſt particular Perſons, but againſt the People called <hi>Qrs.</hi> and the Light within. Alſo that in purſuance of his Malicious purpoſe to render them <hi>Diſloyal and Rebellious,</hi> he forges <hi>Five Articles</hi> in the <hi>Qrs.</hi> Name, as their Belief concerning <hi>O. Cromwel,</hi> and the late King and the Powers, &amp;c. as in his Articles 91, 92, 93, 94, 95. which he forges on the ſaid G. B's Letters aforeſaid, on purpoſe to render the <hi>Qrs.</hi> as odious and offenſive as poſſibly he can (ſome-what like <hi>Jeroboam</hi>'s Prieſt, ſaying, <hi>Amos hath conſpired againſt thee,</hi> Amos 7.10.) to incenſe the preſent Government againſt them. As for inſtance, <hi>Art.</hi> 91. this Prieſt thus proceeds in his Forgery, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Pr. <hi>We</hi> Qrs. <hi>do believe, that</hi> O. Cromwel <hi>was one of our Friends,</hi> &amp;c. And</p>
            <p>Art. 92. <hi>We</hi> Qrs. <hi>do believe, that</hi> O. Cromwel <hi>was no Rebel, nor <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurper, nor Traytor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſerve.</hi> Thus the cruel Prieſt our Adverſary hath moſt mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly and moſt Knaviſhly Forged theſe things in the <hi>Quakers</hi> Name, as <hi>Articles</hi> of their Faith: which were never ſo made, much leſs agreed upon by the <hi>Quakers</hi> as Articles of their Faith. Beſides G. B. plainly teſtified againſt <hi>Oliver Cromwell</hi> (even when Protector) and ſo did <hi>Edward Burroughs</hi> whom this Prieſt quotes and upbraids for Reproving the Rulers of <hi>England</hi> for their <hi>Covetouſneſs</hi> and <hi>Corruption,</hi> and telling them the <hi>Lord will cut them off,</hi> &amp;c. whereupon the Prieſt Exclaims againſt

               <hi>E.

B's</hi> Book quoted by him, was Printed in the Year 1654, as he confeſſeth, which was in <hi>Cromwells</hi> dayes: So that this Prieſt is offended at thoſe Teſtimonies that ſtruck at <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi> and <hi>his Corrupt Magiſtrates.</hi> How abominably hath this Prieſt played the Knave and abus'd us in a moſt ſordid manner, both in theſe two cited Articles and in many others, which with the aſſiſtance of a Diabolical Inſpiration he has contriv'd and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in the Pit of Darkneſs and Habitation of Cruelty, where his Spirit is converſant among the unclean lying Spirits, who further manifeſts his Folly and Ignorance in his Diſcant or Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphraſe upon <hi>Nicholas Knights</hi> Book, Entituled, <hi>A Compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon between the true and falſe Miniſters,</hi> Printed 1675. After this Prieſt hath told us, that in this <hi>Quaking Book the falſe Miniſters of</hi> England <hi>are thus deſcribed;</hi> and after ſeveral Deſcriptions given of them, the Prieſt cites theſe following in his pag. 142. which I recite directly as he has done, viz.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tythes are only claim'd by falſe Teachers.</hi> (I ask him where did true Ones, or Chriſt's Miniſters ever claim them?)</p>
            <p>
               <hi>They deny the Doctrine of Chriſt enlightning every one with a ſaving Light [and that truly, for it is a Quaking falſhood.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>They deny the manifeſtation of the Spirit in all, they reproach the true Miniſters of the Light [and juſtly, becauſe of their Folly.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>They are Perſecutors of the Children of Light [but the</hi> Quakers <hi>have no Truth nor Righteouſneſs to be perſecuted for.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>They deny that any are made Perfect from all Sin in this Life [which they ought to do.]</hi>

            <p>Pr. pag. 103. <hi>Its no marvail, that the</hi> Qrs. <hi>do ignorantly plead for a perfect Freedom from all Sin in this Life; for this is

               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Then Prieſt, to be ſure, thy Mouth ought to be ſtopt; for much of thy work here, is pleading, ſtriving and contending for Sin; reiterating the ſame ſinful Doctrine of thine againſt Perfection and Freedom from Sin in this Life over and over, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently; and therefore thou art therein the Devil's Mouth, and not the Mouth of God nor Chriſt: The Devil pleads for Sin, and ſo doſt thou; thou and the Devil are manifeſtly united together againſt Chriſt and all his Followers in this matter: and therefore ſtop thy Mouth for ſhame, thou Flattering, Sin-pleaſing Prieſt, who ſtrengtheneſt the hands of Evil-doers, that they may not forſake their ſins (like the falſe Prophets of old) promiſing them Life, Juſtification, Peace and Salvation in a ſinful ſtate.</p>
            <p>Pr. Ibid. <hi>But to affirm the In-being and Dwelling of Sin in the beſt of men in this World, is no ſiding with the Devil in the ſame Plea.</hi>

               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Here the Prieſt hath accuſed the beſt of men in this World, with the <hi>In-being</hi> and Dwelling of Sin; and is not this a pleading for Sin and a ſiding with the Devil againſt Chriſt's Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation and Work, which is, to take away Sin, to deſtroy the Work of the Devil? and if to Deſtroy it, then not to let it have a Being or Dwelling in any true Believers. The beſt of men are free from conſenting to the <hi>In-being</hi> of ſin, much more from pleading or contending for it; <hi>for being made free from Sin, and become Servants to God, ſuch have their Fruit unto Holineſs, and the End Everlaſting Life,</hi> Rom. 6.22.</p>

            <p>Pr. The Prieſt Anſwers, <hi>In theſe few words this</hi> Qr. <hi>hath given a moſt Blaſphemous account of all</hi> Qrs. <hi>for he ſaith, that they are made Partakers of Chriſt's Divine Nature; that they are Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans thus made.</hi>

<pb n="97" facs="tcp:152498:55"/>Falſhood to abuſe us; for the matter here oppoſed by him, as it is in <hi>James Parnel</hi>'s Book, p. 176, 177. <hi>Collect.</hi> is not placed in theſe words, as that <hi>All Qrs.</hi> are made Partakers of Chriſt's Divine Nature; but the words are more general, relating to the <q>Church of Chriſt and his Members, who live by the Faith of the Son of God, who are New Creatures in Chriſt Jeſus, ſet free by the Law of the Spirit of Life, and are made Partakers of the Divine Nature of Chriſt, by which they are made <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> and ſuch now witneſs the effect of the Blood of Chriſt wrought within them, and the End of his Coming, and the Benefit of his Death, who are dead with him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q> [Thus far <hi>J. Parnel.</hi>]</p>
            <p>Obſerve well here, that I ſhall not let this Prieſt paſs, as only making Exception againſt <hi>all the Qrs.</hi> being made Partakers of Chriſt's Divine Nature, but alſo I muſt take him as oppoſing the thing it ſelf, that his Quarrel is not only againſt the Perſons <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,</hi> but againſt the thing, i. e. <hi>the partaking of Chriſt's divine Nature,</hi> wherein his groſs Ignorance both of Chriſtianity and Scripture will farther appear in what follows.</p>
            <p>Pr. p. 116. <hi>Behold, here is our Saviours Godhead ſhared a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the</hi> Quakers; <hi>behold, here are the</hi> Quakers <hi>made more than Co-heirs with Jeſus Chriſt, no leſs God than himſelf is.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Behold, here the Prieſt hath not only ſhewn his lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Ignorance, but his falſe as well as blaſphemous Inference: for us to own a being made partakers of Chriſts Divine Nature. He counts this not only a ſharing of our Saviours Godhead a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, but alſo a making our ſelves no leſs than God himſelf, which is a ſad and moſt Ignorant Inference, that new Creatures in Chriſt and his Members may not partake of his Divine Nature, unleſs they be God and Chriſt himſelf! What ſad and miſerable blindneſs and Irrational Work is this! As if the Member of a Body muſt not partake of the Nature of the Body, unleſs that Member could be the whole Body:
<note place="margin">Heb. 3.14.</note>

And can all this be? can any be ſo nearly related and joyn'd to Chriſt, and not Partakers of his
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:152498:56"/>Divine Nature? Can they be Partakers of Chriſt, of his Power,
<note place="margin">Heb. 3.14. Rom. 11.16, 17.</note> Spirit, Virtue, Life, Faith, Divine Image, Holineſs, and have him therein form'd in them, and yet not be Partakers of Chriſt's Divine Nature? What ſtrange Inconſiſtency is this! Though the Prieſt will not own this of the <hi>Qrs.</hi> we impoſe it not ſo upon him; yet will he own it of any of Chriſt's Members? No: See what follows, as his Conſequence on the Aſſertion, and farther Evidence of his great Blindneſs and Ignorance both of Scripture and Chriſtian Experience.</p>
            <p>pr. Ibid. <hi>Every Real</hi> Qr. <hi>is truly Godded with God, and Chriſted with Chriſt (according to this Abominable Quaking Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion) they are all Partakers of that ſame Divine Nature, which Chriſt hath—Quaking Blaſphemy—Intolerable Blaſphemy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> See now how it is, the Aſſertion itſelf, that this Prieſt oppoſes, <hi>viz.</hi> The Partaking of the Divine Nature, which Chriſt hath; this he puts theſe black Characters, <hi>Quaking Blaſphemy, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable Blaſphemy</hi> upon: We will not contend, whether all called <hi>Qrs.</hi> partake thereof or no; for I don't affirm it, becauſe its poſſible for ſome to be Unfaithful under that Profeſſion, and may hold the Truth in Unrighteouſneſs; but whether any Saints, Members of Chriſt, or New Creatures be Partakers of the Divine Nature of Chriſt, I affirm, they are, as every true Branch that is grafted in the true Root, partaketh of the Root and Fatneſs of the Olive Tree, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.17. And ſaith Chriſt, I am the true <hi>Vine,</hi> and ye are the <hi>Branches,</hi> he that abideth in me, and I in him, the ſame bringeth forth much Fruit; for without me (or ſevered from me) ye can do <hi>nothing,</hi> John 15. Now doth not every ſuch Branch partake of the Nature &amp; Virtue of the Vine? Did you ever hear of a Branch in any Vine that beareth Fruit without partaking of the Nature, Virtue or Sap of the Vine? But it ſeems, here is a Prieſt, a Teacher, that would be counted a Member of Chriſt, a Chriſtian, a Believer, a True &amp; Fruitful Branch (no doubt and yet altogether Void and Deſtitute of the Nature, Virtue and Life of the true Vine, which can be neither true in Spirituals nor in Temporals.</p>
            <p>And for a Final Confutation of his folly in this Great Point, take one Scripture more, 2 Pet. 1.3, 4. <hi>According as his Divine Power hath given unto us all things that portain unto Life and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:152498:56"/>through the Knowledge of him that hath called us to Glory and Virtue, whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious Promiſes, that by theſe you might be</hi> PARTAKERS <hi>of the</hi> DIVINE NATURE, <hi>having eſcaped the Corruption of the World, which is through Luſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mark here, how plain it is, that the Apoſtle did confeſs, how they were <hi>Partakers of the Divine Nature,</hi> which our Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry has counted ſuch an Abominable Aſſertion and Intolerable Blaſphemy. Thus he hath Reproached and Blaſphemed the Primitive Chriſtian Doctrine, and Attainment in and by Chriſt his Divine Power and Nature, which the Saints were made Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Pr. To this the Prieſt Anſwers, viz. <hi>In theſe Quaking Lines we have ſuch an account given of the true Church of God as was never heard nor read of till within theſe Thirty Years by paſt, ſuch an account as no Age of the Primitive Church can render the like, except in a</hi> Qrs. <hi>Conventicle, this true Church is not to be found on Earth.</hi>

He has here ſuch an Account of the true Church of God as it ſeems he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver heard nor read of, before he knew the People called <hi>Quakers.</hi> But he falſly preſumes in ſaying, <hi>that no Age of the Primitive Church can tender the like, and that this true Church is not to be found on</hi> Earth; by which he has rendred his own Church no ſuch true Church.</p>
            <p>But why is it ſuch a ſtrange Account of the true Church? Is it ſtrange, that there ſhould be one Head, Chriſt, one Teacher, one Lord, one Lawgiver, one Faith, one Baptiſm, one Light, one Life, one Way, one Shepherd and one Sheep-fold, one Prieſt over the Houſhold of God, one Hope, one Family, one God and Father of all in this true Church? This is not ſtrange to the
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:152498:57"/>Church of Chriſt, which is Conſtituted of true and living Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of one Body, who live by the Faith of the Son of God, and are new Creatures in Chriſt Jeſus, who are gathered and bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized by one Spirit into one Light, Life and Power, and ſo into one Body, according to Scripture, ſeeing the Prieſt is ſo igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of theſe things, I deſire him to read theſe Scriptures at lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 33.22. <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.31, 32, 33, 34. <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.8, 9, 10, 11. <hi>John</hi> 6.45. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54.13. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.13.

            <p>And let this Caution be taken by the way, That whoever go out from us, ſeparate themſelves and turn into Emnity, Malice or Wickedneſs, after they have ſeen and taſted of the great
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:152498:57"/>Power and Work of the Lord among us, they fall into a worſe and more dangerous ſtate than thouſands are in, who never had this Knowledge (Wilfully to ſin againſt ſuch Knowledge is far worſe than to be in the time of Ignorance, wherein God winked) their latter End is worſe with them than the beginning; it had been better for them not to have known the Way of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And though we do not Exclude all, who are not yet gathered into an outward Society with us, from having any ſhare in that inward and inviſible Life, Spirit, Faith, Union or Salvation, which we are made partakers of. For there are thoſe that <hi>Wiſh well to Zion,</hi> that have a love to her, and a drawing towards her, that God hath regard to them, and will proſper in their honeſt Deſires. And there are thoſe that are <hi>Not againſt us,</hi> that are for us, <hi>Luke</hi> 9.50. And God hath a regard to Inward Sinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and honeſty of Heart, though clouded under various Forms and Profeſſions. There are thoſe that have a Simplicity and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence in their Heart towards God, and are free from Enmity againſt his People, that yet are not come to have their Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings ſo clear, as to come into an outward Society and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance in all things with the gathered and choſen of the Lord, that yet have a ſecret breathing unto him in Spirit, whom he will in his own time gather unto himſelf; as Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Other Sheep I have, which are not of this Fold, them alſo I muſt bring, and they ſhall hear my Voice, and there ſhall be one Fold and one Shepherd,</hi> John 10.16.</p>
            <p>However, I would not be miſtaken, though all are not come to that viſible Society and open Teſtimony, which God hath gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us into, and brought forth publickly among us through many deep Sufferings and Reproaches, yet I do not own nor believe
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:152498:58"/>Salvation by any other Chriſt, Goſpel, Light, Spirit or Power, than that which we have received from God and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Howbeit thus far there is an Univerſal Union among all People ſaved of the Lord, when in the way of Salvation, that there is not an Envy nor an evil mind in one againſt another, but a certain degree of Innocency, Love and good Will; all which ſprings from that one, univerſal and divine Principle of Life, Light and Grace in the Hearts which we teſtifie of.</p>

For it follows not from ſaying, the Body of Chriſt or his Church is but one, that Chriſt hath no Spiritual or Glorious Body peculiar to and of himſelf, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Church contains Members. For what's more plain, than where its ſaid, <hi>For as the Body is one, and hath many Members, and all the Members of that one Body being many, are one Body, ſo alſo is Chriſt,</hi> 1 Cor. 12.20. Then that all
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:152498:59"/>thoſe many Members, and that one Body of Chriſt, whereof they are Members make upone Body collectively and joyntly in Chriſt and that the Church and Members of Chriſt, as joyn'd to him and his Body, to make up one Body in univerſal Union and Fulneſs of Chriſt Jeſus; ſo as all are joyned to him, and Members of his Body, of his Fleſh and of his Bone; this makes us one Body, where there is likewiſe one Chriſt, who takes in and compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends with him both his own Glorious Body (like unto which the Body of the Saints Lowneſs was to be faſhioned. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.21.) and all the Members thereof, who are joyned to him in that My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterious Union, that is between Chriſt and his Church, as he is the true Vine, and they the Branches. And granting ſtill that Chriſt has a Glorious Body moſt near &amp; proper to himſelf, above and more excellent than all our Earthly Bodies, like unto which he will change our Low and Humble Body, 'tis not improper to ſay, The Body is one, and hath many Members; and all the Members of that one Body, being many, are one Body. Now are there many Members, yet but one Body, 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 12.20. And there is one Body and one Spirit, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.4.

            <p> But this Prieſt ſtill proceeds in his Envious Attempts, telling us, <hi>That to ſpeak the</hi> Qrs. <hi>Mind more fully, two of his Neighbour</hi> Qrs. <hi>told him, That Chriſt's Body did vaniſh at his Aſcenſion; and that now he hath no other Fleſh or Body, but the Fleſh or Body of his People,</hi> p. 124.</p>
            <p>To which I anſwer, That the firſt is a palpable Untruth; I deny it to be the <hi>Qrs mind,</hi> that <hi>Chriſt's Body did vaniſh</hi> (ſo as to be annihilated) <hi>at his Aſcenſion.</hi> 'Twas chang'd and more glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but not vaniſht. To the laſt part, accuſing two of his Neighbour <hi>Qrs.</hi> with telling him ſo, this is very queſtionable and ſuſpicious; the man's Credit is at ſuch a low ebb with me, becauſe of ſo many Lyes caſt upon the <hi>Qrs.</hi> that I do greatly ſuſpect this Story againſt two of his Neighbours. And I am al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſatisfied, that none in their right Underſtanding or Senſe would give him any ſuch miſtaken Anſwer or Account concerning the Body of Chriſt, that it ſo vaniſhed as to become annihilated. Though ſome Adverſaries have been apt to be too Curious in their Enquiries about that Point, obtruding Unlearned Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons more than are neceſſary to Salvation. We are ſatisfied, that the ſame Chriſt that humbled himſelf to the Death of the Croſs, is highly Exalted, and hath a Name and Authority given unto him, unto which every Knee muſt bow, and every Tongue confeſs; and the Mouthes of Gain-ſayers ſhall be ſtopt in the Day of his Power, which is dawned in our Age; Glory to God and to the Lamb forever.</p>

            <head>AN APPENDIX IN Vindication of the Soundneſs of the <hi>Q<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>AKERS</hi> Faith from the ſaid Adverſary's Fictitious Creed, Unſound Faith, and moſt Knaviſh Forgeries and Sordid Abuſes, as ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by him in the <hi>Quakers</hi> Name.</head>
            <p>SInce that inſtead of an <hi>Index,</hi> our Adverſary the Prieſt hath added an <hi>Appendix</hi> of Ninety Eight Articles in number, which he would have the Reader to look upon as <hi>the Quakers <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound Faith,</hi> and which he is bold to ſet down as <hi>the Quakers Belief,</hi> and that with reference to what he hath in the foregoing Diſcourſe, taken out of <hi>their own Books,</hi> and all which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes to do <hi>either in their own words, or according to the true Meaning of them.</hi> By the Letter <hi>Q.</hi> is meant <hi>Quakers,</hi> page 144, 145.</p>
            <p>By all which the Reader may obſerve, that all theſe Ninety Eight Articles, which he has framed in the <hi>Qrs.</hi> Name, he would have the Reader look upon them as the <hi>Qrs. unſound Faith.</hi> Whence it follows, that none of them are according to his Faith: let this be remarked by the way. And therefore
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:152498:61"/>I ſhall give the Reader a few Inſtances out of the aforeſaid Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles.</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt, To ſhew that many of them are neither ſet down in the <hi>Quakers own words,</hi> nor in the <hi>true Meaning of them;</hi> and therefore that the Prieſt is a manifeſt Forger therein.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly, That there are many Truths ſet down in many of the Articles, which are not according to this <hi>Prieſts Faith,</hi> becauſe he has given them all the Title of the <hi>Qrs. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nſound Faith.</hi> Which things premiſed to be obſerved, I proceed:</p>
            <p>Pr. Art. 1. <hi>We</hi> Q. <hi>do believe, as</hi> W. P. <hi>doth write, that Jeſus Chriſt is not a diſtinct Perſon without us, and that there is not one place of Scripture to prove him to be ſo; nor do we believe Chriſt to be God-Man, for it is no Scripture-phraſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is a Forgery and Perverſion, as from a Denyal of the Terms to a Denyal of the Thing. Jeſus Chriſt is owned to be a Diſtinct Intelligent Being without us, but not as wholly excluded and limited only as a Circumſcribed <hi>Perſon without us;</hi> he is within us alſo ſpiritually. As alſo to ſay, <hi>We do not believe Chriſt to be God-man,</hi> is a down right Slander; for we have fully declared him to be both God and Man; ſee Section 2.</p>
            <p>Pr. Art. 2. <hi>We</hi> Qrs. <hi>do believe that the Scripture is not a Rule directing our <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtandings or Lives.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Falſe again; we have granted the Holy Scripture to be a Rule, but not the Only, the Primary or Chiefeſt Rule: The Holy Spirit and Divine Light hath the Preeminency and Preference as a higher and more univerſal Rule, even where the Writing comes not. §. 2, &amp; 3.</p>
            <p>Pr. Art. 5. <hi>We</hi> Q. <hi>do believe, that the Juſtification of a Sinner is not by Chriſt's Righteouſneſs imputed; that Juſtification by Chriſt's imputed Righteouſneſs is a Dangerous Sin-pleaſing No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Falſe again: Chriſt's Righteouſneſs, as imputed or reckoned by himſelf to true Believers, we believe, and never oppoſed it: but the Imputation or Reckoning of it to Perſons wholly unſanctified by Sin-pleaſing Teachers, we do oppoſe. §. 5, 6, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>.</p>
            <pb n="109" facs="tcp:152498:61"/>
            <p> Pr. Art. 6. <hi>We</hi> Q. <hi>do believe, that Chriſt God-Man did never purchaſe the Redemption of any Sinners by the Price of his own Blood.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> A groſs Perverſion: We do believe, that Chriſt as Mediator hath obtained Eternal Redemption for us, and that by his own Blood, that we might be ſanctified and redeemed from all Iniquity, for which End he gave himſelf for us. But not that he, as God-Man, did ſtrictly purchaſe or buy Redemption of God the Father in a way of rigid or ſtrict Payment &amp; in the Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders ſtead, to acquit and clear the Wicked or Guilty, in whom no Good is wrought, that they may live and dye in Sin, and yet be eſteemed the Redeemed and Juſtified of the Lord. This is the plain Caſe, and this we cannot believe. But that Chriſt gave himſelf a Ranſom for all, to redeem and purchaſe loſt Man to God, out of the Fall, and out of Tranſgreſſion. §. 9, 10. ſee alſo §. 5, 6, 7.</p>
            <p>Pr. Art. 7. <hi>We</hi> Q. <hi>do believe, that there is no Salvation to be hoped for, after this Life is ended, by any faithful Chriſtians; and that there is no Reſurrection of the Body from the Grave unto Life Everlaſting.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Manifeſt Falſhoods: We believe both Everlaſting Salvation, Reſurrection and Everlaſting Life from the Dead, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to holy Scripture; but that the Appearance of Chriſt unto Salvation is not to be put off, nor Salvation from Sin defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red till after Death. And this alſo anſwers his Forgery reitera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and enlarged in his eighth Article. But only his ſaying, <hi>That there is no Coming of Chriſt as Judge at the Laſt Day,</hi> is alſo a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Falſhood. See §. 11.</p>
            <p>Pr. Art. 9. <hi>We</hi> Q. <hi>do believe, as the Papiſts do, that true Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification is only by Inherent Righteouſneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Here's a Perverſion again: for we do not place a ſecond or compleat Juſtification, Salvation or Heaven upon the <hi>Merit</hi> or <hi>Deſerving</hi> of our own Works of Charity, &amp;c. as the Papiſts do, rendring God <hi>a Debtor</hi> to them for thoſe Works af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the firſt Grace received: Herein we manifeſtly differ from them. And we do not place Juſtification wholly upon the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:152498:62"/>Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, but alſo upon his Merit and Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in procuring or obtaining Eternal Redemption for us by his Blood, Suffering and Sacrifice. Yet that abſolute Juſtification is not compleated without the Inherent or Inward Righteouſneſs of Chriſt through Faith and Sanctification we muſt confeſs. §. 6, 7, 10, &amp; 12.</p>
            <p>Pr. Art. 10. <hi>We</hi> Q. <hi>do believe, that Jeſus our Saviour is not the Son of</hi> Mary, <hi>nor the Son of the Subſtance of the Father.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Theſe are both Groſs Lyes, the point is cleared be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: We never denyed, (but alway believed) Jeſus our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour as Miraculouſly conceived by the holy Ghoſt overſhadow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and born of her: As alſo, we never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed, but ever believed him, as he is the Eternal Son of God, to be of his Fathers Subſtance. §. 13.</p>
            <p>Pr. Art. Ibid. <hi>That</hi> Mary <hi>is not the Mother of God; its Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery to call</hi> Mary <hi>the Mother of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This he has ſet down, as part of the <hi>Qrs.</hi> Unſound Faith; and therefore his Faith is, That <hi>Mary</hi> is the Mother of God; &amp; 'tis not Popery to call <hi>Mary</hi> the Mother of God. The reſt of the Forgeries in this Article are anſwered before. §. 13.</p>
            <p>Pr. Art. 12. <hi>We</hi> Q. <hi>do believe, that Deliverance from Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation is not by believing in Chriſt, who dyed to ſave Sinners by his Blood, but by obeying the Light within.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is a Groſs Perverſion and Forgery again: Chriſt and his Light within are not to be divided in the matter of Faith or Salvation. We never oppoſed Chriſt who dyed for Sinners, or Faith in his Name by believing or in obeying his Light within. For he that believes and walks in his Light, believes in his Name, and thereby partakes of the Fruit of his Death and Blood to cleanſe from all Sin. §. 14.</p>
            <p>Pr. Art. 14. <hi>We</hi> Q. <hi>do believe, that there is no Knowledge of any Truth to be gotten by the Scripture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Here is a Falſhood and Perverſion again; for we do believe, that a Knowledge of ſome Truths may be gotten by the Scripture, and more eſpecially through the Bleſſing of God <hi>enlightening</hi> the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding</hi> in the ſerious reading the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; but no ſaving Knowledge is gotten by the Scripture <hi>alone,</hi>
               <pb n="111" facs="tcp:152498:62"/>without the Bleſſing of God, by his Spirit enlightening the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding. §. 14, 15.</p>
            <p>Pr. Art. 29, 30. <hi>We</hi> Q. <hi>do believe, that there is no outward Civil Honour due to the King, to Magiſtrates and Men in Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, or any others.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Falſe again; 'twas never an Article of the <hi>Qrs.</hi> Faith; we have fully expreſt the contrary, even upon outward and Civil Accounts, as in paying our Taxes, Cuſtoms and Duties, and actually ſubmitting to Authority as <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> in all caſes conſiſtent with the Peace of our Conſciences; and paſſively, in ſuffering in caſes wherein we could not be active for Conſcience ſake. But it is the <hi>Hat</hi> and <hi>Knee Honour, Bowing, Creeping</hi> and <hi>Cringing,</hi> Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering Titles and Complements, which this Prieſt is doting upon; 'tis not the ſubſtantial Honour, Dignity, Eſtimation or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence that his Conteſt is for, but what's meerly Complement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and pleaſing to the fleſhly Mind and Pride of Man. §. 17.</p>
            <p>Pr. Art. 47. <hi>We</hi> Q. <hi>do believe, that all Lords, Ladies, Knight<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> His Falſhood and Knavery herein is ſufficiently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected before in his leaving out the general Conditions of <hi>Mercy</hi> and <hi>Salvation</hi> propoſed to the Wicked, viz. <hi>Repentance, Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking their Iniquities,</hi> &amp;c. without which they are liable to Deſtruction and Miſery, which are in their way; ſee Sect. 24. 'Tis a plain Lying Forgery, to make their being <hi>No Qrs.</hi> the Condition of their Deſtruction; as if we ſhould condemn all to utter Deſtruction who are not formally <hi>Qrs.</hi> ſo called: We ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver went about thus to confine the Mercy of God. For there are both Thouſands of Infants that dye Innocent, as alſo many Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of Perſons that have a Degree of Innocency, being free from Envy and Malice againſt us and others; and many in Dark Times and Diſpenſations, that having a Secret <hi>Sincerity</hi> in their Hearts to God, who never were Reputed <hi>Quakers,</hi> nor formal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gathered into an outward Society with us, that yet <hi>may</hi> and <hi>do</hi> find Mercy, and partake of the common Salvation, tendred
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:152498:63"/>in Chriſt Jeſus to Mankind. But <hi>No Fallen, Sinful</hi> or <hi>Poluted</hi> Man or Woman can find Salvation without Repentance or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Converſion by the Grace of God, that has appeared to all men, that they may be taught to deny Ungodlineſs and World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Luſts. §. 31.</p>
            <p>But now more briefly to ſum up and recite ſome more of the Prieſts Lyes, Wicked Forgeries and Falſhoods in others of his Articles, I ſhall thus proceed.</p>
            <p>Art. 54. <hi>That there are no Right Magiſtrates, but</hi> Qrs. <hi>and ſuch Quaking Magiſtrates,</hi> &amp;c. This is a Knaviſh and Idle Forgery. §. 25, 26.</p>
            <p>Art. 54. <hi>That not</hi> Thouing <hi>one another, is a Damning Sin,</hi> is a Lying Forgery again. §. 17, &amp; 26.</p>
            <p>Ibid. <hi>That all Superiority, Nobility, Honour, Breeding,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>are under the Curſe of God,</hi> is a Perverſe Lye.</p>
            <p>Ibid. <hi>That there is no true Nobility, true Gentility, but in us</hi> Qrs. <hi>that Honour is only due to us</hi> Qrs. Theſe are Knaviſh For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geries ſtill. §. 26.</p>
            <p>Ibid. <hi>That any of us deſpiſed</hi> Qrs. <hi>is more Noble, than either King or any Nobles after the Fleſh, becauſe of the Noble Seed in us.</hi> No Article of the <hi>Qrs.</hi> Faith, but the Prieſts Forgery.</p>
            <p>Ibid. <hi>That all Noble men, Gentlemen, Superiours, Men of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, Breeding, &amp;c. are Baſtards.</hi> An Odious Forgery to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der us Odious. See §. 17, 18.</p>
            <p>Art. 58. <hi>We</hi> Q. <hi>do believe, that it is the Devil, who tells men, that Chriſt dyed for all.</hi> This is a Horrid Lye, Wicked Slander and Moſt Abominable Forgery; for that Chriſt dyed for all men, we have alwayes believed and owned, as teſtified by his Spirit in his holy Apoſtles and Scriptures. §. 9, 10.</p>
            <p>Art. 59. <hi>That they who ſaid, they believed, that that was the Chriſt who dyed at</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>and that he dyed for their Sins, and roſe again, and ſitteth at the Right Hand of God, were no Chriſtians in Truth.</hi> This again is a Wicked Perverſion and Falſhood, and alſo a Curtailing of <hi>J. Parnel</hi>'s words (as the Prieſt has more at large cited them, pag. 105, 106.) as if the <hi>Qr.</hi> denyed theſe things relating to Chriſt, whereas 'tis ſpoken of ſuch falſe Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians as had the Hiſtory or Profeſſion of Chriſt, but were not in

            <p>Art. 66. <hi>That to know God according to the Scripture, is no true Knowledge of him.</hi> This is a groſs Lye and Forgery again; for truly to know God by the Revelation of his Son, is accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Scripture, though given by Chriſt. §. 14, 15.</p>
            <p>Art. 72. <hi>That all true</hi> Quakers <hi>have the ſame Gift of the H.

            <p>Art. 78. <hi>That to redeem and make free from Sin, is done with the Body of Chriſt which we have told you, is the Church.</hi> A Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion ſtill, as if the Church only did redeem and free it ſelf, whereas 'tis Chriſt, in and with his own Body, that redeems his Church, which is that Body of his, whereof he is Head.

            <p>Art. 83. <hi>That Fellowſhip at the Lords Table is very wicked.</hi> Is alſo a perverſe falſhood; for ye cannot eat at the Table of the Lord and the Table of Devils. Covetous Prieſts and Wicked People though they have the Sign or Shadow, yet are ſhort of the Lord's Table, and partake not of the Fleſh and Blood of Chriſt nor of his Supper, while they ſhut him out of their Hearts. §. 16. &amp; 25.</p>

            <p>There are divers more Forgeries, Perverſions and Falſhoods in the Prieſts Articles, which for brevity's ſake I omit; and ſhall now give the Reader an Account according to my ſecond Propoſition before ſtated of ſome <hi>Truths ſet down</hi> in the Prieſts Articles, which are not according to his Faith, he having given them all the Title of <hi>the</hi> Quakers <hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> We do believe that the Spirit of Truth is all-ſufficient (for thoſe Ends 'tis given for) and leadeth into all Truth, that true diſcerning of Spirits is a Gift of this Spirit, and that we ought to walk in the Light of Chriſt Jeſus, and his Spirit as the chief Rule of our Faith and Practice; which things it ſeems this Prieſt does not believe; he believes not that the Spirit alone doth give true Diſcerning, or that the Divine Light thereof ought to be his Rule; He believes the Scripture to be the Rule of Life without the Light within, as he has told us, p. 120. §. 14, 15.</p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> But this the Prieſt will not at all believe; he cannot enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſuch mean and hard Thoughts of that Doctrine, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyes or oppoſeth a Sinleſs Perfection in this Life. He does not believe, that to argue for the Being of Sin in all Men Term of Life, does either maintain the Devils Kingdom, or that 'tis an Eaſie Delightſom way to the Fleſh; whenas it muſt needs be more grateful and pleaſing to Corrupt Fleſh, to have Sin re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining all its Dayes, in falſe hopes of Happineſs hereafter, than to be crucified and mortified unto ſin in this Life; without which I believe and teſtifie, men cannot be Happy hereafter, whatever the Prieſt's Belief is to pleaſe Corrupt Fleſh; as his belief, <hi>That Believers in Chriſt ſin daily; and that the Righteous man ſins ſeven times a day:</hi> We are neither of his belief herein, nor yet that any of Chriſt's Miniſters did ever teach or perſwade
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:152498:66"/>people into ſuch a Faith for Sins Continuance, or thus to accuſe the Believers and Righteous with ſinning daily, and ſeven times a day; herein he has wrong'd the Scripture. For though 'tis ſaid, <hi>For a Juſt man falleth ſeven times,
<note place="margin">Prov. 24.16.</note> and riſeth up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,</hi> yet 'tis neither ſaid, that he ſins ſeven times a day, nor that he ſins daily. Neither does it appear, that this Juſt Man's falling ſeven times, is a falling into Sin, but rather a falling into Affliction and Trouble: as it is ſaid, <hi>He ſhall deliver thee in ſix Troubles; yea, in ſeven there ſhall no Evil touch thee,</hi> Job 5.19. Its evident, that the Juſt Man's falling ſeven times, and riſing up again (<hi>Prov.</hi> 24.16.) is oppoſed to the Wicked's falling into Miſchief; and Verſ. 15. its ſaid, <hi>Lay not in wait, O Wicked man, againſt the Dwelling of the Righteous, spoil not his Reſting place; for a Juſt man falleth ſeven times, and riſeth up again;</hi> which makes it more clear, that this intends the Juſt Man's falling into Trouble and Suffering, by reaſon of the Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed laying in wait againſt him. And to this purpoſe ſee <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.23, 24. <hi>The ſteps of a good man are ordred by the Lord, and he delights in his Way; though he fall, he ſhall not be utterly caſt down, for the Lord upholdeth him with his hand.</hi> §. 21. &amp; 28.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is contrary to the Prieſts Faith ſtill: he believes, that they who abide in the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt ſin daily, ſin ſeven times a day, ſin all their Life-time, which is contrary to plain Scripture, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.6. <hi>Whoſoever abideth in him</hi> (that is, in Chriſt) <hi>ſinneth not:</hi> And ſee Chap. 2.1. But ſeeing this Prieſt believes not, that he that abideth in Chriſt ſinneth not, but that he ſins ſeven times a day, he believes not his own Prayer in the <hi>Lyturgy,</hi> viz. <hi>Vouchſafe, O Lord, to keep us this day without ſin:</hi> And a little after (Miniſter) <hi>O God, make clean our Hearts within us:</hi> Anſw. <hi>And take not thy holy Spirit from us.</hi> And <hi>Almighty Father,

               <pb n="119" facs="tcp:152498:66"/>Surely this Prieſt doth not preſent theſe Prayers to God either in Faith or Reality, but only in pretence and ſhew from the Teeth outward. §. 28. See alſo §. 7. &amp; 11.</p>
